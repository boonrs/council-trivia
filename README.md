# Council Trivia

Have you read articles during elections that ask the same questions of all candidates? [Here](http://www.boulderweekly.com/article-11774-boulder-city-council-candidate-questions-and-answers.html) is an example.

This turns those questions into a quiz, adding the opportunity not to pre-judge when seeing a name next to an answer.

This is a prototype, so don't expect anything fancy:
